<em>The Shepherd Journal</em> is accepting submissions of articles from organizations, businesses, and residents in Shepherd. Stories can be about upcoming events, announcements about ongoing projects, athletic competitions, or even just general news about the community. I am also open to reviews or commentary about TV, books, or movies.

You can submit your article, story, or event announcement by clicking on the "Contact Us" button on the Shepherd Journal Facebook page or going to the "<a href="http://www.shepherdhistory.org/shepherdjournal/submit-your-story/">Share Your Story</a>" page on the Shepherd Journal page.
