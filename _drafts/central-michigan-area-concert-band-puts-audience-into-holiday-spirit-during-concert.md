<p>The Central Michigan Area Concert Band filled the SHS Auditorium with warmth and Christmas cheer this afternoon during their annual concert. As usual, the concert band performed a wide range of classical and contemporary music ranging from "A Christmas Festival," "March of the Toys," and "Sleigh Ride."

The audience was invited to participate by singing during the band's performance of "It's Christmas!"

Here is a collection of the songs performed by the band during the concert. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJaJn7VBs1RhUNioxMvxmshQ1_WEDV2_g">Or you can watch on YouTube</a>.
