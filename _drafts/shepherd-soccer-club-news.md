<strong>Jon:</strong> Here are a couple of announcements which were posted on the <a href="[https://www.facebook.com/shepherdsoccerclub/?fref=ts](https://www.facebook.com/shepherdsoccerclub/?fref=ts)">Shepherd Soccer Club Facebook page</a> recently.

<h2>Equipment Closet</h2>

New to our program we would like to start a equipment closest...if you would like to donate any new or used Soccer equipment to our program please contact Dave 444-0082.

Kids seem to grow out of shin guards so quickly these could be reused with someone who needs a pair. Soccer balls are always a need with 100+ kids playing and practicing. Soccer balls must be stitched and size 4 or 5

Thanks everyone...
