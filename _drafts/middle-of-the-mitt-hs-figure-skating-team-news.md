<p>The Middle of the Mitt High School Figure Skating Team had its first District competition of the season on Saturday in Kalamazoo. The team, which consists of figure skaters from Shepherd, Mt. Pleasant, Gladwin, Big Rapids &amp;amp; Sacred Heart, is broken down into three smaller teams (A, B &amp;amp; C) based on skating level.

Shepherd Freshman, Angelina Myers, skated extremely well and helped the C-Team earn 3 medals at the event, one gold &amp;amp; two bronze. The C-Team finished the day in 3rd place. Shepherd Junior, Kayla Morgan, put in a strong performance against a difficult field and helped the B-Team earn a 5th place ranking on the day. The A-Team, a new addition this year for Middle of the Mitt, debuted to a 5th place finish as well.

The next competition for the teams will take place on January 21, 2017 at 1:00 pm at the Mt. Pleasant ICE Arena. We hope to see a lot of Bluejays in the stands cheering on the team!
