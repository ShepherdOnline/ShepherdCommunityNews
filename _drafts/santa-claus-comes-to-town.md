<p>A crowd of Shepherd residents stood waiting in front of the Shepherd Park Thursday evening as a parade of emergency vehicles, the SHS Marching Band, and other floats escorted Santa Claus to his workshop.

Once he was in front of the park, Santa greeted several children as he climbed down from the fire truck he had been riding on and made his way to his workshop. Next door, in the Elf house, a crew of helpers were waiting to hand out treats to visitors.

Nearby, the Shepherd High School and Middle School choirs were singing Christmas music, and kids visited with the reindeer which waited inside a temporary pen behind Santa's workshop.

While kids waited in line with their parents for their change to visit with Santa, other visitors walked around Downtown Shepherd. The downtown was decorated with lots of lights on the trees, and in the windows of stores.
