# Shepherd High School student recognized for random acts of  Kindness

## From: Jay Gross

A young man...

A very special young man went around and put notes on each high school locker yesterday...

Many are still hanging there...

Kindness and thought...

And it just took a little effort...


## From: Shepherd High School

Noah Schafer...we are so proud of you. Your random act of kindness did not go unnoticed. Thanks for making Shepherd High School a great place to be.
